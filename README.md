My Final Year Project on IoT and embedded System
IoT Based Smart Poultry Farm
Hello Everyone..
In this project multiple sensors are connected to Arduino Uno 
DHT 11 sense Temperature and Humidity
MQ136 sense air condition or ammonia gas level
Ultrasonis sensor used for measure water level water tank
IR sensor used for measure Feed level in feeder
And RTC DS3231 module is used for timely work done
and collected data from all the sensors are send to database through GSM SIM900A
All the records display on 16X2 LCD Display
And finaly data in database fetch on website.
